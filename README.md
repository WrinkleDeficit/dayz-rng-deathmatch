# Dayz Deathmatch with random loadout and rotating locations.

Deathmatch files used on my private DM server.

## Installation
Copy and Paste **init.c, missionConfig.c, missionConfigItems.c and missionConfigLocations.c**  to dayzstandalone/mpmissions/dayzOffline.chernarusplus

Should work with other maps but you need to create your own play areas in missionConfigLocations.c

## Optional configuration
1. Make sure your server config includes the values listed in serverDZ-recommended.cfg
2. Make sure your cfggameplay.json includes the values listed in cfggameplay-recommended.json
3. Disable dynamic contaminated areas https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Contaminated_Areas_Configuration
